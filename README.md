# Function-equation-calculator

This program is a simple calculator that determines the equation of the linear and quadratic function by always inserting two coordinates into the equation, thus resolving its unknowns. For the linear function, the slope and the y-intercept can be calculated. To determine the function terms of a quadratic function, two coordinates and only one known function term are entered. This is automatically inserted into the general form and resolved.
